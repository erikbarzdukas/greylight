## Collaborative malware research. ##

## "Shining light on those hard to reach places"  ##

## Summary ##
  GreyLight is a malware sample file upload/download service that packages VirusTotal information with samples. This enables
an easier and more rapid spread of malware samples among researches and other interested parties. 

## Problem ##
 Current techniques for collecting malware samples are through honeypots and intentionally reckless Internet use. This is
creates a high barrier to entry for those without the resources or domain knowledge required to do either effectively. Additionally,
this creates fragmented groups of malware samples and pockets of research.

## Solution ##
  GreyLigight allows anyone interested in malware to acquire samples simply by downloading them from our service. Included in the archive
is VirusTotal information about the sample, and any additional research around the sample. This enables the spread of research and lowers the barrier
to entry for curious minds.
